                  Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas.
                  The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. Its elevation of 8,848.86 m was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.
                  Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name,
                  Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally “Peak of Heaven.” Its
                  identity as the highest point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized, however, until 1852, when the governmental Survey of India established that fact.

                   Everest is so tall and its climate so severe that it is incapable of supporting sustained human occupation,
                   but the valleys below the mountain are inhabited by Tibetan-speaking peoples. Notable among these are the Sherpas,
                   who live in villages at elevations up to about 14,000 feet (4,270 metres) in the Khumbu valley of Nepal and
                   other locations.

                  <h2> Habitation</h2>
                  <p>
                 Living in close proximity to the world’s highest mountains, the Sherpas traditionally treated the Himalayas
                 as sacred—building Buddhist monasteries at their base, placing prayer flags on the slopes, and establishing
                 sanctuaries for the wildlife of the valleys that included musk deer, monal pheasant, and Himalayan partridge.
                 Gods and demons were believed to live in the high peaks, and the Yeti (the so-called Abominable Snowman) was
                 said to roam the lower slopes. For these reasons, the Sherpas traditionally did not climb the mountains.
                 However, beginning with the British expeditions of the early 20th century, surveying and portering work became
                 available. Eventually, the respect and pay earned in mountaineering made it attractive to the Sherpas,
                 who, being so well adapted to the high altitudes, were capable of carrying large loads of cargo over
                 long distances. Though Sherpas and other hill people (the name Sherpa came to be applied—erroneously—to all
                 porters) tend to outperform their foreign clients, they typically have played a subordinate role in expeditions; rarely, for example, has one of their names been associated with a pioneering route on Everest. The influx of foreign climbers—and, in far greater numbers, trekkers—has dramatically changed Sherpa life, as their livelihood increasingly has come to depend on these climbing expeditions.

               <h2> Karnali River </h2>
              <p>  The Karnali rises from Mt. Kailash on the Tibetan Plateau, and flows 671 miles to its confluence with the Ganges River in India.
                   The river provides water for millions of people, provides for fish and wildlife resources and has a high value for ecotourism
                   especially in the form of whitewater rafting and as an approach corridor to the Sacred Mt. Kailash.
                   These ecological services sustain livelihoods throughout the Karanli River Basin.
