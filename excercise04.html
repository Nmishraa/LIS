        <h2> Mount Everest</h2>

        <p> Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas.
            The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. Its elevation of 8,848.86 m was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities.
            Like other high peaks in the region, Mount Everest has long been revered by local peoples. Its most common Tibetan name,
            Chomolungma, means “Goddess Mother of the World” or “Goddess of the Valley.” The Sanskrit name Sagarmatha means literally “Peak of Heaven.” Its
            identity as the highest point on the Earth’s surface was not recognized, however, until 1852, when the governmental Survey of India established that fact.

         <h2> Karnali River </h2>
        <p>  The Karnali rises from Mt. Kailash on the Tibetan Plateau, and flows 671 miles to its confluence with the Ganges River in India.
             The river provides water for millions of people, provides for fish and wildlife resources and has a high value for ecotourism
             especially in the form of whitewater rafting and as an approach corridor to the Sacred Mt. Kailash.
             These ecological services sustain livelihoods throughout the Karanli River Basin.
